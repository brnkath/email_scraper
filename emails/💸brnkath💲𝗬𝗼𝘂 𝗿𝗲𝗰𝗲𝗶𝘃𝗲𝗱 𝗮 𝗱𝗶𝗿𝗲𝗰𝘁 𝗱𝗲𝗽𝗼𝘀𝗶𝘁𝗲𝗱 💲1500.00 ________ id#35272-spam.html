Dear Professor,
As you may have noticed, our office has changed our procedures for
students who require disability accommodations. Instead of receiving a
paper letter or an email with an attached letter directly from the
student, you are now receiving an email Notification of ADA-­‐authorized
Accommodations. In this email you will see all of the accommodations
that the student is eligible for. In at least one student’s case, they are
eligible for alternative testing accommodations. To complete this
eligibility request, professors need to submit a testing contract letting
our office know how long your exams are and what the student is
allowed to bring in with them to the exam. It is only after you have
completed this contract that the student will be able to request to
schedule their exam. You will no longer have to complete the test
proctoring request form that we have used in the past.
Please complete this contract as soon as possible. I am providing
detailed instructions on how to do so below. Please note that regardless
of how many students in your course are eligible for alternative testing
accommodations, you will only have to complete one contract per each
course section. In addition, you should fill this contract out even if you
plan to proctor exams yourself so that we have an accurate record of
how the student is receiving this accommodation and so that you will no
longer receive these reminder emails requesting that you complete the
process.
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email me or call
me at 410-­‐516-­‐3838.
Sincerely,
Cristina Finan
Assistant Director of Student Disability Services

Alternative Testing Contract Instructions
1) In the original Notification of ADA-­‐authorized Accommodations email
there is a red box with a link to the contract for that specific course
section. Please click on the link to access the contract:
2) Once you have accessed the contract you can choose between two
options “I Will Proctor My Own Exams” and “I will use the SDS Office to
proctor my exams”. Please select the appropriate choice and then click
on the button labeled “Continue to Fill Contract”.
3A) If you selected “I will proctor my own exams” you will see the
screen below and you will only need to provide us with a contact
number before clicking on the button labeled “Submit Alternative
Testing Contract”. Once you have clicked that button you will have
completed the process and the accommodation will be correctly tracked
for that course section for all eligible students.
3B) If you selected “I will use the SDS Office to proctor my exams” you
will see the screen below and you will have to answer three questions
asking about allowable materials during exams, additional
accommodations that you may need, and the use of a calculator. You will
then need to tell us the length of exams, quizzes, and the final. Finally,
you will need to provide contact information for our office to use during
an exam incase a student has questions about the exam. There is space
provided to write any additional notes about your class testing such as
variable times for exams or any other information you think we should
have. Once you click on the button “Submit alternative testing contract”
you will have completed the process and the eligible students in that
course section will be able to submit exam scheduling requests.

DECISIONS
DECISIONS
Teacher’s Guideu4zR1vl3PYxl3D6k2LHz
Dear Teachers,J2UXTRySFoSzYFlgKH86b09U2TLF9AyYDFuh2YsWc6RW6ljxvT8tQzVMJy8PhKEXyDxTmu0DxYlNTYaE
This book, DECISIONS, is about two young people, Frank and Jennifer, and how they reached
a decision not to smoke cigarettes. This educational material, in a format called a photonovela,
was developed with students of Franklin County Technical School. A ninth grade English class
wrote the story and the Questions for Thought. A biology class wrote the fact sheet, Body
News. Several other classes worked on counter-advertisements. Many students participated
as actors, photographers, designers, and directors. We've listed the home towns of the various
participants in the hope that your students may know some of the people involved.
Student produced health education material will, we hope, hold greater interest and appeal for
your students and enable them to identify with the role models established by their peers.
The goal of the book is to support smoking prevention efforts. The story illustrates various steps
in the decision making process. We offer this to you as an addition to your current health
education efforts. We believe that this book can be used in various ways and serve as the
basis for several lessons.
The Questions for Thought, when discussed in class, will enable students to explore Frank and
Jennifer's decision. The book can serve as the basis for a reading lesson, as a motivation for a
science or health lesson, and/or as a dramatization of media, peer, parental pressures
regarding smoking behavior.
May we suggest a few additional activities?
GOAL: To enable students to identify, understand, and counter various pressures for
unhealthful behavior.
OBJECTIVE A: Students can identify pressures for and against healthful behavior.
KEY QUESTIONS: Frank and Jennifer were trying to decide whether or not to smoke. Where
did they get information: Who/what may have encouraged them to smoke? Who/what may
have encouraged them not to smoke? Can we list out the pressures that they felt from both
sides? Can we add any others?
ACTIVITY: Fill in the following chart.
pressure to not smoke pressure to smoke
OBJECTIVE B: Students can identify the techniques used by advertisers.
KEY QUESTIONS: What do ads try to tell us about smoking? Is this information true? How do
ads try to make us feel? What techniques do they use?
ACTIVITIES: Students examine ads (one copy of a TIME magazine will yield 8 to 9 full page
cigarette advertisements). Students write out the hidden message (e.g. smoking is tough,
smoking is romantic). Students then develop their own counter ads. The counter ads in
DECISIONS may serve as motivation. Students may -wish to superimpose their own text over
existing ads or may prefer to develop their own drawings and text.
OBJECTIVE C: Students will be able to demonstrate how decisions are influenced by group
pressure.
KEY QUESTIONS: Do you think that Frank or Jennifer were influenced to try smoking? To
what extent are our decisions influenced by other people? What tactics do people use to
persuade someone to do something? Students may wish to list examples (e.g. flattery, logic,
facts, threats, promise of reward).
ACTIVITY: Students try an experiment illustrating conformity to a group. The class is divided
into two groups. Group 1 leaves the room. Group 2 draws lines of equal size (but of varying
slopes) on the blackboard. Some students from group 2 agree to call line B the longest line.
When group 1 returns to the room, students are asked to rank the lines according to size.
Several students (from group 2) insist that line B is the longest. Record answers of students
and discuss the experiment. Did people change their opinion when others insisted? Students
discuss situations where they might be pressured to smoke because others are smoking.
?
OBJECTIVE D: Students will be able to role play assertiveness in various pressure situations.
KEY QUESTIONS: Why is it sometimes difficult to express our feelings and opinions? Why, at
the start of the story in DECISIONS didn't Frank or Jennifer tell their friends that they do not
smoke, have never smoked, or do not want to smoke?
ACTIVITIES: Situations are sketched out in which people are pressured to smoke. E.g. You
are at a party and many of the people are smoking. John offers you a cigarette. Karen says,
"Come on; join us!" Jean says, "What's wrong? Are you afraid?"
The class offers suggestions for handling the situation. Some students role play using the
suggestions offered by the class. Discussion of the situations and alternative responses follows
the role play.
GOAL: To enable students to identify and understand the decision making process.
OBJECTIVE A: Students will be able to identify how important decisions are made.
KEY QUESTIONS: How did Frank and Jennifer make their decisions? What steps did they
take? How often do we make important decisions? How many of our decisions are made
without thought? with careful thought?
ACTIVITIES: Students describe some difficult decision that they had to make recently and
share with the class (1) how they made the decision, and (2) who or what influenced them to
make the final choice.
Students list the steps people took to make their decisions and try to order the list (e.g. clarify,
consider alternatives, obtain information, consider consequences, choose the best alternative,
follow-through, share decision with others).
OBJECTIVE B: Students will identify and "measure" the decision making process of smokers
and non-smokers.
KEY QUESTIONS: Do smokers actively decide to be smokers? What has influenced non-
smokers?
ACTIVITIES: Class draws up an interview form so that they can interview adult smokers and
non-smokers and then analyze results. Some of the questions might be: did your parents
smoke? did many of your friends smoke? who was with you when you first smoked? when did
you decide to become a smoker.? Students may want to have different interview forms for
smokers and for nonsmokers.
Each student does two interviews: one with a smoker and one with a nonsmoker OR half the
class interviews smokers and the other half interviews nonsmokers.
Class tallies results and discusses findings.
METHODOLOGY
Most smoking prevention educational efforts with school age children have concentrated on
knowledge change with the assumption that increased knowledge about the harmful effects of
smoking would discourage the onset of smoking. However, this has not been proven to work.
For example, surveys of school age smokers have consistently indicated that they have a
knowledge of the health effects of smoking.
Every day, approximately 4,000 children become smokers. About 100,000 children under the
age of 13 are regular smokers. Among girls age 1 2 to 14, the percentage who smoke has
increased eight fold since 1968.
Furthermore, research has indicated that those students who do smoke tend to have an
external locus of control (a belief that fate or others outside of themselves control or determine
their health). We believe that a focus on decision making and an understanding of how to
counter negative pressures and arguments will enable students to develop an internal locus of
control (a belief that they have the ability to control some of the factors that relate to their
health) and help them make an active decision not to smoke.
Several studies in health education have indicated the important role peers, parents, and other
models such as teachers have played. In addition, it has been found that a child's self
perception also plays an important role. Within the last few years, there has been a shift away
from knowledge change strategies to the use of affective educational activities such as
discussions about feelings and emotions as they relate to cigarette smoking and the various
pressures to smoke.
We hope that our photonovela, DECISIONS, will provide a stimulus for affective educational
activities. We also hope that you enjoy the product as well as the process!
May we ask that you f ill in the enclosed evaluation sheet once you have used the photonovela
with a class. A Lifeways staff person will collect these forms from the main office. We would
love to hear about additional lessons that you may have planned for the use of this book!
